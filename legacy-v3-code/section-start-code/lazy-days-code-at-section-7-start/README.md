# Section Start Code

Code to support the Udemy course [React Query: Server State Management in React](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-react-query/?referralCode=1479BB9FA7CA6F31671E)

## To install

1. Copy the `client` folder to your project directory, overwriting any `client` folder that is already there.
1. `cd` in the `client` folder and run `npm install`.
1. If you already have the `server` and `shared` folders from a previous iteration of the lazy-days-spa project, there is no need to copy these, as they do not change from the beginning of the course. If you do not have these folders, copy them into your project folder and follow the installation instructions in the README.md within the `server` folder.
